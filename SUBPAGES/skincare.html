                <p class="steps_heading">1 Makeup remover &amp; Oil cleanser</p>
                <p>Oil cleanser is just the beginning step in the Korean routine. Feels relaxing to use it and also removes all the elements of the makeup, build up sebum or sunscreen. Always start your routine with this smart product.
                </p>

                <p class="steps_heading">2 Water based cleanser</p>
                <p>The second step is the foaming cleanser, which dissolves and removes the water-based dirt (sweat and dust) what the oil cleanser did not pick up. Put water-based cleanser as a next step right after the oil cleaner to make your skin look like flawless.
                </p>
                <p class="steps_heading">3 Exfoliator</p>
                <p>Physical and chemical exfoliator help clean pores and remove the dead skin cells for a visibly brighter and smoother skin. Regular exfoliation will also help the following skin care products to absorb well, so they will work more efficiently. <br><br>
                    Use it once a week and your skin will be grateful for that.<a href="https://www.byrdie.com/best-homemade-face-scrubs-10-great-recipes-346788" class="readmore"><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right">Read more...</i></a>

                <p class="steps_heading">4 Toner</p>
                <p>Toners are the supreme prep products at the market, that removing all the leftovers from the above products and also repairing the skin's barrier. And also helps to the following moisturizers to absorb well. Your skin is like a sponge, it hard to rehydrate it when its dried out and damp, put some toner after the above steps to clean it completely.

                <p>Treatments
                    That means serums and other boosters that makes your skin fulfilled with precious ingredients. They can fight with specific problems like acne or wrinkles. Your skin dries out regularly? Treat it with some hyaluronic acid.

                </p>
                <p class="steps_heading"> 7 Sheet Masks</p>

                <p>If essences are the heart of the Korean skincare routine, let’s say masks are the soul of it. The sheet masks are fulfilled with precious ingredients, can’t wait to hand over to your skin. You can use it as needed, and if you combine it with a meditation, it will be equal with a Home-SPA experience.</p>

                <p class="steps_heading">8 Eye Cream</p>

                <p>As we all feel it, the skin area around the eyes are the thinnest and most delicate. That area needs more attention, than anything else. Use well formulated product with concentrated ingredients to say goodbye to the dark circles and puffiness.</p>

                <p class="steps_heading">9 Moisturizer</p>

                <p>You can find the moisturizers in many forms, like: emulsions, lotions, creams or sleeping masks. The point is to always proceed from the thinnest consistency to the thickest. They really good in plumping your skin and smoothing the fine lines.</p>

                <p class="steps_heading">10 Sunscreen</p>

                <p>The last but really not the least is the sunscreen. I recommend to always use sunscreen to avoid the premature ageing of your skin. The UV rays unbelievably damaging the skin, so put the sunscreen as a last step. (daytime only!)</p>

                <p class="steps_heading">Do I need to use all the steps?</p>
                <p> I showcased all the steps of the Korean routine, but I would recommend to set your routine to your personal skin’s need and your skin goals. Good luck!
